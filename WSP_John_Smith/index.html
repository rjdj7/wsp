    <p class="description">Hello. My name is John Smith and I'm a student at Full Sail University that is majoring in Web Design and Development. 
    I'm currently enrolled in the <strong>Web Standards Project</strong> course, which is being taught by Professor Brandon Brown. What you see here is the product
    of my first assignment in this course: <strong>Building a Library.</strong> Here is where I'll keep portfolio of my components and other things during the course of this class. </p>

    <hr class="textborder"><br><br>

    <h2>Components</h2><br>

    <h3>1. Header (Kotaku.com)</h3>

    <img class="component" src="img/header.png" alt="header" width="900px"/>

    <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Any audience.</p>
    <p><strong>Client's Goals/User's Needs:</strong> Provide a simple, uncluttered header that only displays necessary information (the company's name) while providing some (subtle) additional funcitonality. Example, clicking the logo sends you home, while clicking the "hamburger" icon drops down a list of other blogs.</p>
    <p><strong>Critique:</strong> Like I mentioned above, the header is simple and clean. It just has the company's logo, and hides its extra functionality under small, collapsable icons. This is good design because it shows you only what you need to see, and hides all other content inside buttons. This is much better than leaving them all out on display, moving them, or taking them away from the user entirely. The icons have recognizable functions: the lightning bolt will collapse a list of notifications (and will glow yellow if you have any unread ones); the user thumbnail will open up a dropdown for your account settings; the magnifying class will expand a search bar, etc. </p><br>

  
    <h3>2. Navigation (Polygon.com)</h3>

    <img class="component" src="img/navigation.png" alt="navigation" width="900px"/>

    <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Any gaming audience.</p>
    <p><strong>Client's Goals/User's Needs:</strong> Give the user a compressed main navigation so they don't get overwhelemed by choices, and immediately grasp the user's attention by promoting recent content related to that navigational item in a dropdown selection. Also give the user additional ways to personalize their browsing. </p>
    <p><strong>Critique:</strong> I really, really enjoy this navigational setup because it manages to show a lot and a little at the same time. In the screenshot above, just by hovering over the "reviews" tab on the navigation, Polygon gives us a nice rundown of their recent reviews, allowing use to see at least five different reviewed games and their scores, before clicking on the one that interests us. It gives the user the content they're looking for immediately, without forcing them to navigate away from the page right away. </p><br>


    <h3>3a. Featured (Polygon.com)</h3>

    <img class="component" src="img/featured.png" alt="featured" width="900px"/>

    <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Any gaming audience.</p>
    <p><strong>Client's Goals/User's Needs:</strong> Show the user the most important/popular content by making it stick out.</p>
    <p><strong>Critique:</strong> Polygon has a really nice way of putting its featured content right on the forefront. Visiting their homepage, you can't help but notice the big purple thumbnails on the top of the page. The large white headlines contrast nicely with the purple overlay, drawing your attention quite effectively. Another nice touch is that the article with the most hits/comments has a bigger thumbnail, and you can see the exact number of comments in the upper right hand corner of the thumbnail.</p><br>


    <h3>3b. Featured Alt (Ign.com)</h3>

    <img class="component" src="img/featured2.png" alt="featured alt" width="900px"/>

    <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Any gaming audience.</p>
    <p><strong>Client's Goals/User's Needs:</strong> Display a live slidehow of featured content. List details and related articles in the descriptions of those slideshow images.</p>
    <p><strong>Critique:</strong> Live slideshows are always good for making content stick out. The big slideshow images and their sliding animation from one to the next grabs your attention quickly. The descriptions give you a good idea of what to expect from the article and the related articles give the user choices in case they're interested in the material, but not that specific article. Another nice touch is the "play" button icon in the lower left-hand corner of the thumbnail, which lets the user know that the article features video content.</p><br>


    <h3>4. Feed (Gameinformer.com)</h3>

    <img class="component" src="img/feed.png" alt="feed" width="500px"/>

    <img class="component" src="img/feed2.png" alt="feed" width="500px"/>

    <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Any gaming audience.</p>
    <p><strong>Client's Goals/User's Needs:</strong> List the most recently posted articles and their associated thumbnails, and provide some meta information without cluttering the post. </p>
    <p><strong>Critique:</strong> What I like about Game Informer's feed setup as opposed to other gaming sites, is that its layout is consistent. When it comes to their articles, visually, each one is treated as equally important. All thumbnails are the same size, each description is typically a single line, each "panel" (for lack of a better word) that contains the article brief all have the same distribution of white space, so on and so forth. This makes the feed easier to look at, and it also makes it so that each writer on the site has the same level of exposure.</p><br>


    <h3>5. Related (Kotaku.com)</h3>

    <img class="component" src="img/related_content.png" alt="related content" width="500px"/>

    <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Any gaming audience.</p>
    <p><strong>Client's Goals/User's Needs:</strong> List past related articles (that are actually relevant) on posts that have related content.</p>
    <p><strong>Critique:</strong> I enjoy this feature on Kotaku, because it presents me with extra information on a certain topic without being intrusive or out of place. On Kotaku's regular feed, there are full-size posts that span the length of it's container and then there are posts like the one in the screenhsot above, which shares that length with related content, by minimizing the posts' thumbnail and using a divider to split the content up the middle. I've found that the related material was always relevant, and never just some random article that the website wanted you to see. It's always a helpful and educational feature.</p><br>


    <h3>6. Popular (Ign.com)</h3>

    <img class="component" src="img/popular.png" alt="popular" width="300px"/>

    <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Any gaming audience.</p>
    <p><strong>Client's Goals/User's Needs:</strong> Show what games are currently popular and their review scores.</p>
    <p><strong>Critique:</strong> Sidebar content can sometimes be a tough spot to fill on a website, but IGN does a really good job of this. I love this feature because you can take a quick glance at it and get a great gist of what's happening on the gaming front of the gaming industry, as well as what games IGN recently reviewed.</p><br>


    <h3>7. Coming Soon (Ign.com)</h3>

    <img class="component" src="img/coming_soon.png" alt="coming soon" width="300px"/>

    <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Any gaming audience.</p>
    <p><strong>Client's Goals/User's Needs:</strong> Show a list of anticipated games and their release dates.</p>
    <p><strong>Critique:</strong> I enjoy this feature for the same reasons I enjoy the one above. It's a great way to get a quick update on upcoming games and their release dates. Also, it's listed by the level of hype, so you can good idea of what games people are looking forward to the most.</p><br>


    <h3>8. Account (Gameinformer.com)</h3>

    <img class="component" src="img/account.png" alt="account" width="800px"/>

    <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Any gaming audience.</p>
    <p><strong>Client's Goals/User's Needs:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Critique:</strong> As far as gaming sites go, Game Informer has one of the more in-depth profile page layouts on the web. It has all kinds of customization options, and you get to keep track of things like game reviews you've written, blog posts you've made, articles you've commented on, etc, etc. You even have a friend's list and people can also comment on your profile. For the average internet user (especially if you're in to social networking), these features may not seem all that "new," but it is actually a nice change of pace for gaming sites. Game Informer really does a great job of making their registered users actually feel a part of their community. </p><br>


    <h3>9. Comments (Gameinformer.com)</h3>

    <img class="component" src="img/comments.png" alt="comments" width="600px"/>

    <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Any gaming audience.</p>
    <p><strong>Client's Goals/User's Needs:</strong> Provide a way for the user to participate in active discussion on your website's content.</p>
    <p><strong>Critique:</strong> One thing that I have always been picky about when visiting sites is the comments section. It feels like a lot of sites just can't get it right, but GI does an amazing job. A lot of the time, I run into sites where the comment section is just a mess of people replying to one another and, because the design isn't great, you lose track of what the original comment was and who was talking to who. When I say the design is bad, it's usually because there isn't enough seperating each comment or enough contrast between the comments. Perhaps there isn't enough white space, or indendation isn't used effectively. Whatever the case may be, it can be distracting and can discourage the user from spending too much time in the comments section. Another issue I've run into is a website that will feature a single comment at the top of the comments section and you will have to sift through that entire discussion just to get the the next comment and so on. What I love about GI is that it has none of these problems. Each "main" comment has a good deal of dedicated whitespace and any replies on them are hidden until you click the "view conversation" dropdown that'll have a list of (indented) replies. Replying or commenting is also very easy; the site expands a text box right from where you hit the reply button. No moving around the page required.</p><br>


    <h3>10. Footer (Gameinformer.com)</h3>

    <img class="component" src="img/footer.png" alt="footer" width="900px"/>

    <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Any gaming audience.</p>
    <p><strong>Client's Goals/User's Needs:</strong> Provide an alternative way to navigate the website.</p>
    <p><strong>Critique:</strong> A lot of the websites I've vistited don't usually feature a footer or, if there is one, it's usually minimal (maybe copyright information or something). However, there are sites like Amazon that do have a footer, albeit a large one. Amazon does a good job of organzing their site map, but it's huge. Game Informer's wins my favor because it's much more condensed, making it much less intimidating. To the point where I actually feel comfortable using the footer for navigation just as much as the main navigation itself. Sometimes, a large sitemap isn't always a good thing. </p><br>
